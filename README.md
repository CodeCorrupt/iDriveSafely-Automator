# iDriveSafely Automator

### Summary
iDriveSafely is an online traffic safety class that I have recently taken to get points off my license in Florida. I wrote this extension to click next on each of the pages and simply beep when it reaches a quiz page so the user can answer the questions.

iDriveSafely has way more possible courses than I'm able to test against, but I'm hoping that the course and page structure is the same and just has different content. So this will hopefully work across courses.

### Goals
I'd like to make this work on all iDriveSafely courses and build a database of answers to automatically fill in the correct answers.

Ideally, you will be able to hit go and come back to your computer 4 hours later and have a completed course.
